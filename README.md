# userstyles
User style sheets that make my web browsing better.

Good user interfaces should
- have few visual elements on the screen
- only show you the tools and information that you use
- make efficient use of your screen space

## How to Use
1. Download [`userstyles.json`](userstyles.json) from this repository.
1. Install the [**Stylus**](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) browser extension.
1. Go to the Stylus extension's **Details**.
1. Click **Manage Styles**.
1. Under **Import**, click **Import styles**.
1. Choose `userstyles.json` that you just downloaded.

## Targeted websites
On all sites, underlines will intersect with text, instead of leaving a gap around descenders, which is ugly and distracting.

|Site|Changes|
|---|---|
|Inoreader|Removed clutter. Made videos more obvious, since Inoreader automatically strips `controls` and `autoplay` from videos, making them look like images. Made certain thumbnails appear only on hover.|
|JSON Editor Online|Fixed layout calculation when ads are blocked.|
|Slack|Enlarged emoticons.|
|Stack Overflow|Removed clutter on question pages.|
|Twitch|Enabled HTML5 video context menu, useful for Video Popout.|
|Twitter|Removed clutter, ads, and unwanted tweets. Render avatars in rounded rectangles instead of circles.<br>You can block keywords with [Larry Filter for Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/larry-filter-for-twitter/ifgdeokhnfkbgdocafpokgdnnfbnbbok?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog).|
|Wikipedia|Removed clutter.|
|YouTube|Removed clutter. Works best with [Magic Actions for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog).|
