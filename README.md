# userstyles
User style sheets that make my web browsing better.

Good user interfaces should
- have few visual elements on the screen
- only show you the tools and information that you use
- make efficient use of your screen space
- not be annoying

## How to Use
1. Download [`userstyles.json`](userstyles.json) from this repository.
1. Install the [**Stylus**](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) browser extension.
1. Go to the Stylus extension's **Details**.
1. Click **Manage Styles**.
1. Under **Import**, click **Import styles**.
1. Choose `userstyles.json` that you just downloaded.

## Targeted websites
On all sites, underlines will intersect with text, instead of leaving a gap around descenders, which is ugly and distracting.
